 * is limited by the `bufferSize` parameter and then publishes the buffered events up to the total demand if this
 * publisher is active. `ActorPublisherMessage.Request` is handled by publishing the buffered events up to the requested
 * demand and other `ActorPublisherMessage`s (e.g. `Cancel`) stop this actor.
