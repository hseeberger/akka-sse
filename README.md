Akka SSE adds support for [Server-Sent Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource) (SSE) – a lightweight and standardized
technology for pushing notifications from a HTTP server to a HTTP client – to akka-http. In contrast to
[WebSocket](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455), which enables two-way communication, SSE only allows for one-way
communication from the server to the client. If that's all you need, SSE offers advantages, because it's much simpler
and relies on HTTP only.

## Getting Akka SSE

Akka SSE is published to Bintray and Maven Central.

``` scala
// All releases including intermediate ones are published here,
// final ones are also published to Maven Central.
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("hseeberger", "maven")

libraryDependencies ++= List(
  "de.heikoseeberger" %% "akka-sse" % "1.7.6",
  ...
)
```

## Usage – basics

Akka SSE models server-sent events as `Source[ServerSentEvent, A]` with `Source` from Akka Streams,
`ServerSentEvent` from Akka SSE and `A` an arbitrary type on the server-side and `Any` on the client-side.

`ServerSentEvent` is a case class with the following fields:

- `data` of type `String`: payload, may be empty
- `eventType` of type `Option[String]` with default `None`: handler to be invoked, e.g. "message", "added", etc.
- `id` of type `Option[String]` with default `None`: sets the client's last event ID string
- `retry` of type `Option[Int]` with default `None`: set the client's reconnection time

More info about the above fields can be found in the [specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource).

## Usage – server-side

In order to produce server-sent events on the server as a response to a HTTP request, you have to bring the implicit
`toResponseMarshaller` defined by the `EventStreamMarshalling` trait or object into scope where you define your
respective route. Then you complete the HTTP request with a `Source[ServerSentEvent, A]` for an arbitrary `A`:

``` scala
object TimeServer {

  ...

  def route = {
    import Directives._
    import EventStreamMarshalling._

    def assets = getFromResourceDirectory("web") ~ pathSingleSlash(get(redirect("index.html", PermanentRedirect)))

    def events = path("events") {
      get {
        complete {
          Source.tick(2.seconds, 2.seconds, NotUsed)
            .map(_ => LocalTime.now())
            .map(dateTimeToServerSentEvent)
        }
      }
    }

    assets ~ events
  }

  def dateTimeToServerSentEvent(time: LocalTime): ServerSentEvent = ServerSentEvent(
    DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_TIME.format(time)
  )
}
```

If you need periodic heartbeats, simply use the `keepAlive` standard stage with a `ServerSentEvent.Heartbeat`:

``` scala
Source.tick(2.seconds, 2.seconds, NotUsed)
  .map(_ => LocalTime.now())
  .map(dateTimeToServerSentEvent)
  .keepAlive(1.second, () => ServerSentEvent.Heartbeat)
}
```

## Usage – client-side

In order to unmarshal server-sent events as `Source[ServerSentEvent, Any]`, you have to bring the implicit
`fromEntityUnmarshaller` defined by the `EventStreamUnmarshalling` trait or object into scope where you define your
response handling.

``` scala
object TimeClient {
  import EventStreamUnmarshalling._

  ...

  Source.single(Get("/events"))
    .via(Http().outgoingConnection("127.0.0.1", 9000))
    .mapAsync(1)(Unmarshal(_).to[Source[ServerSentEvent, Any]])
    .runForeach(_.runForeach(event => println(s"${LocalTime.now()} $event")))
}
```

If you want the client to reconnect to the server thereby sending the Last-Evend-ID header if available, you can use the
`ServerSentEventClient`:

``` scala
object TimeClient {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    implicit val system = ActorSystem()
    implicit val mat = ActorMaterializer()
    import system.dispatcher

    val handler = Sink.foreach[ServerSentEvent](event => println(s"${LocalTime.now()} $event"))
    ServerSentEventClient("http://localhost:9000/events", handler).runWith(Sink.ignore)
  }
}
```
